# Revature_Project_0_RayF
Project 0, simple text adventure

Initial project with Revature, a basic adventure with a trap, a puzzle, and enemies to face.
Will read some basic lore from a file, randomize a trap and puzzle, randomize enemies and combat elements, and then write a record of the adventure into a new, unique file.
Currently has an endless mode and a difficulty selection that unlock after completing a run.
